    <h1>Playing with software tools to build websites and learning</h1>
    <h2>The focus html/CSS tools to build a simple website</h2>
    <p>Due to an injury leading to knee surgery I have been out of work for a while recovering. With the time, I used up all the videos on YouTube and Netflix... OK, not all... but all!</p>
    <p>Part of this time has been spent learning and hopefully I will get something out of this time staring at the walls</p>
    <p>Next thing I will know I'll be back to working 12 hours a day on controls and reliability.</p>
